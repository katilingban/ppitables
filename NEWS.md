# pptables 0.2.0

This is the second CRAN release of `ppitables`. In this release, I added:

* updates to documentation

* new PPI tables for Ivory Coast, Togo, Philippines and Peru using the new
PPI calculation approach developed by the International Poverty Alliance (IPA)

* update PPI tables for Colombia, Burkina Faso and Zambia

* added `find_table()` which allows user to do a search query for specific PPI
tables

* added `get_table()` which creates a tidy format data frame of user-specified
PPI tables.

# ppitables 0.1.1
This is an updated release of `ppitables` as part of the CRAN submission process. I have implemented the following changes:

accordingly
* I referenced the IPA website in the DESCRIPTION as the developers and maintainers of the PPI tables.
* I missed adding Ecuador and Pakistan PPI tables. They are now included.
* I cleaned up documentation of each country table to become very informative to user
* I have changed LICENSE from MIT to CC0 which is more appropriate
