# Poverty Probability Index (PPI) Lookup Tables

The Poverty Probability Index (PPI) is a poverty measurement tool for
organizations and businesses with a mission to serve the poor. The PPI
is statistically-sound, yet simple to use: the answers to 10 questions
about a household’s characteristics and asset ownership are scored to
compute the likelihood that the household is living below the poverty
line – or above by only a narrow margin.
